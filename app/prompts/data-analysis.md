# Data Analysis Prompt

Use this prompt when you need help analyzing data:

```
I have a dataset with the following characteristics:
- Data type: [describe data type, e.g., time series, categorical, numerical]
- Number of observations: [approximate number]
- Variables: [list key variables]
- Goal of analysis: [what insights you're looking for]

Please help me:
1. Identify appropriate statistical methods for this analysis
2. Suggest data visualization approaches
3. Interpret potential patterns or correlations
4. Note any limitations or caveats in the analysis
```
